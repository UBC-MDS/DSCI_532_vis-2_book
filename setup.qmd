## Python

Here is the working `requirements.txt` to get started for this course.
You may need more packages for your actual project repository.

Make sure you are installing these packages in a separate virtual enviornment (for the course and project).

```
{{< include requirements.txt >}}
```

## LLMs

We will be working with LLMs in this course.

### GitHub Models

You will need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
It does not need any context (e.g., repo, workflow, etc).

General instructions from the GitHub docs on creating a PAT: <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic>

Instructions from the GitHub Models docs: <https://github.com/Azure-Samples/python-ai-agent-frameworks-demos/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#configuring-github-models>
