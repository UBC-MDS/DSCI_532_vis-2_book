In Lecture 3, we'll be following along with the [shiny tutorial](http://stat545.com/Classroom/notes/cm107.nb.html) that I delivered in STAT 545/547 last fall. It's an activity-based version of [Dean Attali's tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/).

The final version of the app that we'll be building can be found [here](https://github.com/vincenzocoia/STAT545_participation/tree/master/cm107/bcl).
