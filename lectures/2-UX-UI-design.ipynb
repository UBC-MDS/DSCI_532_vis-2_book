    "> \"Let’s state the truth: no matter how complex and innovative your back-end is, your application is bad if your user experience (UX) is bad. That’s the hard truth. We have a natural tendency, as R-coders, to be focused on the back-end, i.e. the server part of the application, which is perfectly normal—chances are you did not come to R to design front-ends.  \n",
    "> However, **if people cannot understand how to use your application, or if your application front-end does not work at all, your application is not successful no matter how innovative and incredible the computation algorithms in the back-end are**.  \n",
    "> As you are building a complex, production-grade shiny application, do not underestimate the necessity for a successful front-end - it is, after all, the first thing (and probably the only thing) that the end users of your web application will see. However, our natural back-end/server logic as R developers can play against us in the long run - **by neglecting the UI and the UX, you will make your application less likely to be adopted among your users, which is a good way to fail your application project.**\"\n",
